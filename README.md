# Daniel Craig Discord Bot

## What does this bot do?
This is a Discord bot that sends the "weekend" GIF every Friday around 07:15 PM. Inspired by [@CraigWeekend](https://www.twitter.com/@CraigWeekend) on Twitter.

## Why did I make this?
I.. don't know why. I make my weekends with it now though :)

## Okay, well how do I host it?

Follow this guide to set up your Discord bot on the Discord Developer Portal: https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/create-a-discord-bot-with-python/

Save your API token in a `.env` file as:

`API_TOKEN=<your token>`

If you are hosting it on a private server, have the following packages installed (assuming you have Python 3.10 or higher):
1. discord
2. python-dotenv

Then:

If on Windows, run:

`py -3 ./daniel.py`

If on Linux, run:

`python3 ./daniel.py`
